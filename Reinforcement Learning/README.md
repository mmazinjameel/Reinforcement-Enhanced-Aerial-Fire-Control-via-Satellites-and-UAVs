# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Firefighting


### Requirements
- Developed with Python 3.6
- Requires `numpy` and [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/) (tested with version 1.4.0)

### Files
- `madqn.py`: Implementation of training algorithm, policy architecture, and aerial vehicle model.
- `main.py`: Example usage of algorithm: train and test a network with simulations. 
- `rlUtilities.py`: Helper utilities to simplify implementation of the reinforcement learning problem.
