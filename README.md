# Reinforcement-Enhanced Aerial Fire Control via Satellites and UAVs

This project presents a comprehensive approach to addressing the critical environmental challenge of wildfires through the integration of advanced technologies. Initially, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to detect wildfires using satellite imagery. Utilizing 224x224 pixel images from Landsat 8, multiple CNN architectures are investigated, including Inception, ResNet50, and VGG, all of which are pretrained on ImageNet weights. Additionally, a custom-designed architecture comprising six convolutional layers and three fully connected layers is developed, achieving superior performance with 87% training accuracy and 86% testing accuracy in wildfire detection.

Building on this foundation, the project introduces a novel strategy that leverages a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operated within a distributed deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to autonomously combat detected forest fires. The forest fire scenario is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a factored structure. Due to the computational complexity of optimally controlling forest fires using dynamic programming, a deep RL approach is adopted, wherein each UAV learns an optimal policy based on local information. This integrated approach, combining CNNs for wildfire detection and RL for responsive action, establishes a pathway toward more efficient and autonomous wildfire management solutions.
